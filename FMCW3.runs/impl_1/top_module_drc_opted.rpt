2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
BUFC-1#1 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer USB_DATA_IOBUF[0]_inst/IBUF (in USB_DATA_IOBUF[0]_inst macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

BUFC-1#2 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer USB_DATA_IOBUF[1]_inst/IBUF (in USB_DATA_IOBUF[1]_inst macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

BUFC-1#3 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer USB_DATA_IOBUF[2]_inst/IBUF (in USB_DATA_IOBUF[2]_inst macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

BUFC-1#4 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer USB_DATA_IOBUF[3]_inst/IBUF (in USB_DATA_IOBUF[3]_inst macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

BUFC-1#5 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer USB_DATA_IOBUF[4]_inst/IBUF (in USB_DATA_IOBUF[4]_inst macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

BUFC-1#6 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer USB_DATA_IOBUF[5]_inst/IBUF (in USB_DATA_IOBUF[5]_inst macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

BUFC-1#7 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer USB_DATA_IOBUF[6]_inst/IBUF (in USB_DATA_IOBUF[6]_inst macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

BUFC-1#8 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer USB_DATA_IOBUF[7]_inst/IBUF (in USB_DATA_IOBUF[7]_inst macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.

PLCK-12#1 Warning
Clock Placer Checks  
Poor placement for routing between an IO pin and BUFG. 
Resolution: Poor placement of an IO pin and a BUFG has resulted in the router using a non-dedicated path between the two.  There are several things that could trigger this DRC, each of which can cause unpredictable clock insertion delays that result in poor timing.  This DRC could be caused by any of the following: (a) a clock port was placed on a pin that is not a CCIO-pin (b)the BUFG has not been placed in the same half of the device or SLR as the CCIO-pin (c) a single ended clock has been placed on the N-Side of a differential pair CCIO-pin.
 This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

	USB_CLKOUT_IBUF_inst (IBUF.O) is locked to A15
	USB_CLKOUT_IBUF_BUFG_inst (BUFG.I) cannot be placed

PLIO-6#1 Warning
Placement Constraints Check for IO constraints  
Invalid constraint on register microblaze_i/microblaze_i/axi_quad_spi_0/U0/NO_DUAL_QUAD_MODE.QSPI_NORMAL/IO0_I_REG. It has the property IOB=TRUE, but it is not driving or driven by any IO element.
Related violations: <none>

PLIO-6#2 Warning
Placement Constraints Check for IO constraints  
Invalid constraint on register microblaze_i/microblaze_i/axi_quad_spi_0/U0/NO_DUAL_QUAD_MODE.QSPI_NORMAL/IO1_I_REG. It has the property IOB=TRUE, but it is not driving or driven by any IO element.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1617#1 Warning
use_IOB_register  
The FDRE cell microblaze_i/microblaze_i/axi_quad_spi_0/U0/NO_DUAL_QUAD_MODE.QSPI_NORMAL/IO0_I_REG has IOB set to TRUE, but does not connect directly to an IO cell. Remove the constraint or ensure the FDRE is properly connected to an IO.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1617#2 Warning
use_IOB_register  
The FDRE cell microblaze_i/microblaze_i/axi_quad_spi_0/U0/NO_DUAL_QUAD_MODE.QSPI_NORMAL/IO1_I_REG has IOB set to TRUE, but does not connect directly to an IO cell. Remove the constraint or ensure the FDRE is properly connected to an IO.
